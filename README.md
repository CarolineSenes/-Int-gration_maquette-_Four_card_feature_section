## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Mastering margin collapsing between "Team Builder" and "Karma" articles
Solution : I used flexbox to fix it (style.css l.114,115)



### Continued development

For small projects that don't require SASS, I will continue using CSS custom variables.

### Useful resource
